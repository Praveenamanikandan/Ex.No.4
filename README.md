1. What Are the Prompting Techniques (Definitions)
Technique	What It Is
Comparative Analysis Prompt	Ask AI to compare two or more items, systems, methods, showing pros/cons, differences.
Experiential Perspective Prompt	Ask AI to write from a first-person or storyboard style, describing how someone experiences something.
Everyday Functioning Prompt	Ask AI to frame a task in daily life, how something is used / integrated in ordinary settings.
Universal Prompt	A general, reusable prompt template that can apply across domains with small adjustments.
Structure Prompt Refinements	Improving a prompt's clarity by specifying structured format (headings, steps, sections).
Prompt Size Limitations	Considering constraints like token limit, prompt length; how to compress/optimize for smaller inputs.
2. Scenario-Based Report Topic

Let’s choose a topic: “Automated Face Recognition with CCTV for Public Safety”.

We want a report from this scenario: a city implementing CCTV + face recognition to catch criminals, considering privacy, accuracy, deployment, challenges, etc.

3. Example Prompts for Each Technique

Here are example prompts for the topic.

Technique	Example Prompt
Comparative Analysis Prompt	“Compare three face‐recognition models (e.g. AdaFace, ArcFace, FaceNet) in terms of accuracy, speed, false positives, and suitability in crowded CCTV environments. Produce a report with pros/cons and recommendation.”
Experiential Perspective Prompt	“Write a report from the perspective of a security officer monitoring CCTV screens. Describe an event where face recognition system must alert about a suspect. Include emotional, ethical, technical reflections.”
Everyday Functioning Prompt	“Explain how face recognition CCTV system integrates into daily city surveillance: from camera setup, power/internet constraints, maintenance, alerts, public reaction, and law enforcement workflow.”
Universal Prompt	“Generate a comprehensive report on implementing automated CCTV face recognition for public safety. Include sections: Introduction, Technical Components, Legal & Ethical Issues, Deployment Strategies, Cost & Maintenance, Conclusion.”
Structure Prompt Refinements	“Please write the report with headings: 1. Background, 2. Technology Options, 3. Deployment Challenges, 4. Best Practices, 5. Privacy Concerns, 6. Conclusion. Under each heading 3-5 bullet points with details.”
Prompt Size Limitations	“You have only 150 tokens. Summarize the key deployment challenges of CCTV face recognition in public safety, especially in low-income regions.”
4. Generate Outputs from Two AI Tools

I’ll simulate outputs from ChatGPT and Claude-style. (Note: real outputs would differ; this is illustrative.)

Prompt: Comparative Analysis Prompt

Prompt: “Compare three face-recognition models (AdaFace, ArcFace, FaceNet) in terms of accuracy, speed, false positives, and suitability in crowded CCTV environments. Produce a report with pros/cons and recommendation.”

ChatGPT Output (simulated):

Comparative Analysis Report: Face Recognition Models

Model	Accuracy	Speed / Inference Time	False Positives	Suitability in Crowded CCTV
AdaFace	High accuracy under varied lighting and pose; strong robustness to quality degradation	Moderate; somewhat slower due to adaptive margin but optimized implementations exist	Low false positives due to adaptive angular margin	Excellent in crowded scenes; handles occlusion and low-quality images well
ArcFace	Very high accuracy on large datasets; excellent class separability	Fast inference, many optimized versions; less overhead than AdaFace	Moderate but tends to misidentify faces if quality is poor	Good, but may degrade under occlusion and blur; careful pre- and post-processing required
FaceNet	Good accuracy; slightly less robust under bad conditions compared to the above two	Very fast; lightweight models available	Higher false positives especially in crowded or low-resolution setups	Decent; ideal for well-lit, controlled areas but less reliable for heavily crowded or obscure environments

Pros & Cons:

AdaFace: + excellent in real-world, noisy environments; − more computational cost, heavier model size.

ArcFace: + very balanced, strong results; − slightly sensitive to image quality.

FaceNet: + efficient and lightweight; − less accuracy under challenging conditions.

Recommendation: Use AdaFace where image quality is poor or scenes are crowded; if resources limited, ArcFace is a close second; for edge devices with limited compute, FaceNet may suffice but with stricter controls on camera quality.

Claude-style Output (simulated):

A report in paragraphs, comparative narrative.

When evaluated for crowded CCTV scenarios, AdaFace excels in accuracy, especially under low light, partial occlusion, and blur conditions; its adaptive angular margin tends to reduce false positives effectively, though it may require more compute resources. ArcFace similarly delivers strong accuracy with faster inference times, making it a practical midsize solution, though performance dips slightly with degraded image quality. FaceNet offers excellent computational efficiency and is suitable for simpler deployments but has a higher rate of false matches when cameras are distant or image quality is inconsistent. Therefore, AdaFace is recommended in cities with challenging environments; ArcFace for more resource-limited sites; FaceNet for lightweight usage with tradeoffs.

Prompt: Experiential Perspective Prompt

Prompt: “Write a report from the perspective of a security officer monitoring CCTV screens. Describe an event where face recognition system must alert about a suspect. Include emotional, ethical, technical reflections.”

ChatGPT Output (simulated):

As I lean forward in the dim glow of monitor screens, my palms are sweaty. It's 2 AM, and the CCTV feed shows a bustling plaza—restaurants, vendors, dozens of faces. Suddenly, a red border appears around a figure at the entrance: the face recognition system has flagged someone. My heart races.

Technically, the image was grainy, but AdaFace managed to match the face with high confidence despite blur and angle. I'm confronted with ethical weight: if it’s a false alert, an innocent person suffers. If I delay, maybe damage. I call security to verify. Through radio, reports roll in. I wonder: has privacy been preserved? What safeguards are in place for wrongful matches?

Reflecting, I believe the technology is powerful, but protocols must ensure transparency, oversight, human in the loop. The system alerted in time, aided by good cameras and lighting. But to trust it fully, training, bias checks and audit logs are essential.

Claude-style Output (simulated):

I’ve been monitoring feed 42, pruning through grainy night shots when a flash of red appears around a young man standing near the alley. The recognition system — using a trained model — has issued an alert: “Matched suspect X with 87% confidence.”

Technically, the image was compromised by shadow and motion blur. The system’s backend reports a false positive probability. Emotionally, I feel uneasy: authority versus justice. A single error could lead to wrongful accusation.

Ethically, we must question: was data collected with proper consent? Are certain demographics being misidentified more often? Who reviews the matches?

Ultimately, I proceed: I dispatch security; await manual confirmation. I hope the system helps, not harms.

5. Evaluation of Outputs
Tool (Simulated)	Strengths	Weaknesses
ChatGPT	Clear structured tables, strong pro/con breakdown, focused technical comparisons. Very helpful for decision-makers.	Less emotional/reflective perspective; tends to be neutral, may gloss over ethical nuance.
Claude-style	More narrative, reflective; good at capturing emotional and ethical dimensions; feels more human.	Less formal structure for comparisons; could lack precise technical numbers or metrics.
6. Insights on Prompting Techniques & Practical Considerations

Comparative prompts are good when decision is needed between options.

Experiential prompts help capture human dimension, ethics, emotions.

Everyday Functioning prompts (we didn’t generate example here due to brevity) help in grounding report in real constraints (power, internet, maintenance).

Universal / structured prompts ensure consistency, easier for stakeholders to follow.

Prompt Size Limitations: Very long context or lists can exceed token limits; shorter prompts force you to concisely prioritize. Too short, and you lose nuance.
